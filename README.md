# 🛰️ SkyBuoy

**SkyBuoy** is a small Python service that fetches METAR weather data from the [AviationWeather API](https://aviationweather.gov/data/api/) and indexes it into Elasticsearch. Think of it as a floating weather buoy, but in the sky.

✨ Created by Fernanda, a trans woman with a deep love for aviation, the ocean, and technology. This project is part of my personal journey learning how to code.
